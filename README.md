## Project Overview

This project utilizes the YOLO v5 deep learning framework to enable real-time object detection through a surveillance drone. The system is designed to detect and track both humans and vehicles (2-wheelers and 4-wheelers) from live video feeds.

## Technologies Used

- **YOLO v5**: For detecting objects in video feeds.
- **OpenCV**: For tracking detected objects.
- **Python**: For scripting and integration.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing data.
- **Mission Planner**: For managing drone operations.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Detection**: Identifies humans and vehicles as they appear in the live video feed.
- **Precise Tracking**: Uses OpenCV to track and count objects accurately.
- **Enhanced Security**: Improves surveillance by providing real-time monitoring and tracking.

## Outcomes

Integrated OpenCVâ€™s tracking functionalities to enable precise object tracking and counting, combining both technologies to enhance surveillance in a campus environment.

Improved surveillance capabilities by enabling real-time detection and tracking of multiple objects, enhancing campus security.
